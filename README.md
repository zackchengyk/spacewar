# brown-hiaa0010-spacewar
A Github repository from which you can run my version of Spacewar! locally 
on your computer's web browser. The project is organized as follows:

1) spacewar.html, the actual webpage to be loaded
2) spacewar_styles.css, a file which specifies visual styles
3) spacewar_code.js, a file which contains the code to run the game
