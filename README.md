# Spacewar!

My version of [Spacewar!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!), of one of the first video games ever played. 

Written in Javascript, this was created to make a case for early video games as an offshoot of interactive art/media, and was used as a final project submission for an art history class.

---

The project is organized as follows:

1) `spacewar.html`, the actual webpage to be loaded
2) `spacewar_styles.css`, a file which specifies visual styles
3) `spacewar_code.js`, a file which contains the code to run the game
